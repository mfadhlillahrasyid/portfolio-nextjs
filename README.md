# My First Project with Next.js and TypeScript üöÄ

This repository represents my first project built using Next.js and TypeScript. As part of my journey to master modern web development technologies, I decided to explore these powerful tools to create scalable and robust web applications.

This project is a significant milestone in my learning journey, showcasing my initial efforts in understanding and implementing the features of Next.js and TypeScript.





## üìñ About the Project

This project serves as a learning playground where I experimented with:
- Next.js: A React-based framework for building server-rendered applications with ease.
- TypeScript: A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that helps improve code quality and maintainability.

Through this project, I learned:
- How to set up a Next.js project with TypeScript.
- Creating dynamic routes and handling server-side rendering.
- Utilizing TypeScript to define interfaces, types, and props for React components.
- Styling components using CSS modules and optimizing the application for SEO.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Next.js: For server-side rendering and dynamic routing.
- TypeScript: For type-safe JavaScript development.
- CSS Modules: For component-specific styling.
- Node.js: As the runtime environment for Next.js.
- ESLint & Prettier: For maintaining consistent and clean code formatting.
